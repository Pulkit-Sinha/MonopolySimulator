WELCOME TO MONOPOLY SIMULATOR!

To run this program you will require an IDE like Eclipse or you can run it off your command line too. 
For both, you need to have a recent version of JDK installed on your system. 

On execution, you will be asked to input number of players. Kindly enter an integer from 2-8. 
Game tends to run forever with greater number of people since no one owns an entire color group (as players can't buy and sell
properties among each other) hence no houses so the rent stays low and no one gets bankrupt. 
If you enter something outside this range, you will be informed that you've made an invalid entry and will be asked to input again. 

On entering a valid input, the program will begin simulating a game of monopoly (with a few minor changes*) between the specified 
number of people. 

*The minor changes are:

1. Players cannot mortgage/sell their properties or houses/hotels (however once a player goes bankrupt all their properties are released 
back into the game)
2. There are an indefinite amount of houses/hotels present with the bank
3. Players cannot get out of jail on rolling a 6, only by using a Get Out of Jail Free card or paying the $50 fine. 
4. Some of the Community Chest/Chance cards have been removed for the sake of simplicity

Hope you have a good time with the program.
